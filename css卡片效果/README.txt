A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/YoannN2/pen/PqjJMR.

 So I didn't expect this to get viewed at all - period. 
As said in the comments I didn't come up with it. It's from a tutorial (in french) on  @Grafikart - http://www.grafikart.fr/tutoriels/html-css/card-ui-629

Which itself is based off a dribbble pen from Justin Kwak -> https://dribbble.com/shots/2001637-Article-News-Card-UI?list=users&offset=2

I called it "revisited" cuz i'm a newb and I gave it a go before, it was "sorta" like this but still very ... weird and gimmicky, this version is much better though :3 (still could use some improvements but oh well, getting there :) )
